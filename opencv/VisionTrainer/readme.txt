The vision training code takes video footage of a kite being flown, it identifies
and tracks the largest moving object above a set horizion, and it parses out the
moving object from each frame. The resulting images are put in a folder. These 
images can be used to train a vision clasifier system for the kite used in the
video.

For this script to work the video needs to be very stable. Either use a tripod 
when taking video for use with this script or stabilize the video first.
