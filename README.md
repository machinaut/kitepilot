# Kite Power Autopilot

Can't put any code here yet :) hackathon starts 1930 PDT on March 28th,
so stay tuned.

I'm hoping this is a nice departure from 3d fixed-wing and multirotor
autopilot C&D.  This thing literally has ONE degree of control (kite bar
angle), which is basically "turn left"/"turn right".  It'll also be fun
to try to build everything and get it flying in a couple days.
